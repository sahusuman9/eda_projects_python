# EDA with Pure Python

This folder contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tasks implemented using **pure Python only**, without relying on external libraries like `pandas` or `NumPy`.

These scripts are designed for learning and practicing how data can be cleaned, parsed, and explored using just built-in Python modules such as `csv`, `json`, and string methods.

2. **Employee data**  
   Cleans employee records, handles missing fields, and performs simple department-wise aggregation using dictionaries and loops.

5. **Customer feedback data**

These files are ideal for understanding the **fundamentals of EDA** when libraries are not available.
